This is an educational project made after completing the JavaScript fundamental courses at SoftServeAcademy.

The game "Mineweeper" is written in pure JavaScript. It uses the following technologies:
- interaction with the DOM;
- classes;
- working with local storage;
- recursive functions.
The game has got 3 difficulty levels. The higher the difficulty level, the more bombs are on the field. At the beginning of the game the timer is activated. If the result at a current difficulty level has been improved, a message about the record is displayed.
Thank you for your attention!
